# Analysis-of-Global-Carbon-Emissions-2001-2021-with-Tableau-Visualisations
This Tableau project analyses carbon emissions (2001–2021), examining the impact of GDP and population on flaring, cement, gas, oil, and coal. The dashboard uncovers global, regional, and source-specific trends, offering insights into how economic growth and demographics shape emission patterns for sustainability decisions.
## Dataset and Tableau Visualisation Sources
This project uses the CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset from Our World in Data [(dataset link)](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#explore-data-on-co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions). It provides country-level data on CO₂ emissions from 2001–2021, covering five major sources—flaring, cement, gas, oil, and coal—along with GDP and population metrics. An interactive Tableau dashboard [(tableau link)](https://public.tableau.com/views/CarbonEmissions2001-2021Individual/Dashboard?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) explores emission trends globally and regionally. It shows the impact of GDP and population, highlights source-specific patterns, and includes filters for countries, continents, and top emitters to support sustainability insights.

## Dashboard: Carbon Emissions (2001-2021)
![Dashboard](https://github.com/niloy2974/Analysis-of-Global-Carbon-Emissions-2001-2021-with-Tableau-Visualisation/blob/main/visualisations/Dashboard_Carbon%20Emissions.jpg)

The dashboard combines spatial, temporal, and comparative insights to evaluate carbon emissions across countries and continents. It highlights how GDP and population influence emissions, identifies high-impact sources, and reveals regional variations. Businesses, policymakers, researchers, and environmental organisations can use this analysis to benchmark sustainability goals, design emission-reduction policies, and assess progress toward climate targets.
### Individual Visualisations
#### World Map of CO2 Emissions and Population
Displays country-level emissions using bubble size and colour for emissions and bubble shape for population. This visual helps identify the largest emitters, population-emission relationships, and spatial patterns. Governments and NGOs can quickly spot global hotspots requiring urgent intervention.
#### Data Cards for Average Emissions and Growth
Two KPI-style cards showing average CO2 emissions and average growth across the dataset. They provide at-a-glance metrics for executives, analysts, or climate officers to track high-level performance and long-term impact.
#### Impact of GDP and Population on CO2
Two scatter plots showing emissions against average GDP and average population. Each point represents a country, with trend lines added to highlight global correlations. Economists, policymakers, and sustainability strategists can assess how wealth and demographics drive emissions.
#### Year-wise CO2 Emissions with Sources
An area chart illustrating annual emissions from five sources (flaring, cement, gas, oil, coal). Average trend lines indicate long-term direction, while interactive highlighting shows each source’s contribution. Useful for energy analysts, governments, and climate organisations monitoring shifts in energy dependency.
#### Continent-wise CO2 per Capita with Source
A heat map showing emissions per capita across continents for each source. This breakdown allows global agencies and researchers to compare regional responsibility and guide equitable climate action.
### Key Features
#### Interconnected Visualisations
![Crosslink](https://github.com/niloy2974/Analysis-of-Global-Carbon-Emissions-2001-2021-with-Tableau-Visualisation/blob/main/visualisations/Features_Crosslinks.jpg)

All charts in the dashboard are fully linked, meaning that selecting a country, continent, or top emitter instantly updates every view. This provides a holistic perspective and ensures patterns are analysed in the right context.
#### Flexible Filtering Options
![Filter](https://github.com/niloy2974/Analysis-of-Global-Carbon-Emissions-2001-2021-with-Tableau-Visualisation/blob/main/visualisations/Features_Continent%20Filtering.jpg)

Users can filter data by continent, focus on individual countries, or isolate the top 10 emitters. These filters allow comparisons across scales, from regional trends to country-level performance.
#### Hover Interactivity
![Hover](https://github.com/niloy2974/Analysis-of-Global-Carbon-Emissions-2001-2021-with-Tableau-Visualisation/blob/main/visualisations/Features_Hover%20Insights.jpg)

Detailed tooltips are available across all visualisations, providing exact values of CO₂ emissions, GDP, and population when hovering. This makes the dashboard both interactive and informative.
#### Trend Line Insights
Scatterplots and area charts include average trend lines to reveal long-term patterns. These help uncover how GDP and population growth correlate with emission changes over the two decades.
#### Comparative Analysis
The dashboard allows direct comparison of the five emission sources—flaring, cement, gas, oil, and coal—showing which sectors drive increases or decreases in different regions.
#### Scalable Insights
Designed for policymakers, researchers, and sustainability analysts, the dashboard supports decision-making by making global, regional, and sector-specific emission insights accessible and actionable.
